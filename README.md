Welcome! This repository showcases a collection of small but focused projects I've worked on using **Python**, **Excel/VBA**, and **QGIS**. These projects demonstrate my interest in data analysis and automation.

## Projects

### 1. Battery Storage Simulation (Python)
A basic simulation of battery charging and discharging logic based on assumed figures of solar energy production and energy demand. 
Features:
- Simulated hourly sample data solar input and demand.
- Charging/discharging with assumed efficiency losses.
- Visualization using Matplotlib.
- Potential to enhance by incorporating user input for customizable scenarios.
> Technologies: `Python`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`


### 2. Road Accident Dashboard (Excel + VBA)
An interactive dashboard to visualize road accident data within the years 2021-2022. 
Includes:
- Data analysis, cleaning and then filtering using Pivot Tables.
- Interactive buttons and links for quick access to sources and easy navigation within the Excel sheet.
- Interactive charts and slicers.
- Auto-rotating vehicle category views using VBA.

> Tools: `Excel`, `Pivot Tables`, `VLookup`, `Slicers`, `VBA`, `Custom Macros`


### 3. Germany Statewise GDP and Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg Wind direction and speed Map (QGIS)
Experimental use of QGIS to create maps. Demonstrated:
- Raster calculator and interpolation usage.
- Visualization of spatial data with appropriate layering.
- Usage of Excel/CSV files for data and classification.
> Tools: `QGIS`, `Excel`, `Raster`, `NASA (DAV)`
The QGIS project files and associated GIS data (such as shapefiles and CSVs) are not included in this repository.
This repo focuses on sharing the final map outputs in PDF format.

More projects on the way!

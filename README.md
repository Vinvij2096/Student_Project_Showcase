Welcome! This repository showcases a collection of small but focused projects I've worked on using **Python**, **Excel/VBA**, and **QGIS**. These projects demonstrate my interest in data analysis, geospatial tools, and automation.

## Projects

### 1. Battery Storage Simulation (Python)
A basic simulation of battery charging and discharging logic based on solar energy production and energy demand. 
Features:
- Simulated hourly sample data solar input and demand
- Charging/discharging with assumed efficiency losses
- Visualization using Matplotlib.
- Potential to enhance by incorporating user input for customizable scenarios.
> Technologies: `Python`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`


### 2. Road Accident Dashboard (Excel + VBA)
An interactive dashboard to visualize road accident data within the years 2021-2022. 
Includes:
- Auto-rotating vehicle category views using `VBA`
- Filterable charts
- Clean visual layout with grouped shapes

> Tools: `Excel`, `Pivot Tables`,`VLookup`,`Slicers`, `Custom Macros`,`VBA`


### 3. Spatial Risk Mapping (QGIS)
Experimental use of QGIS to create raster-based maps. Demonstrated:
- Raster calculator usage
- Visualization of spatial data
- Thematic layering

> Tools: `QGIS`, `Raster`, `OpenStreetMap`, `Mask Layers`


Here are some projects Iâ€™ve worked on to get hands-on experience with:
- Data analysis
- Automating processes


More projects on the way!

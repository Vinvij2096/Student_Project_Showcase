# Germany GDP & Wind (Speed & Direction) Mapping Project

## Overview  
The first map visualizes Germany’s states and cities based on GDP and per capita data. The maps highlight regional economic differences using color gradients and boundary thickness variations.
The second map visualizes the average annual wind speed and direction at 50m height over the region of Baden-Württemberg for the year of 2024-2025.

## Germany Statewise GDP Map
- Raw economic and geographic data sourced from Wikipedia & gadm.org respectively.  
- Data imported as CSV and joined in QGIS to create spatial layers.  
- Classification and styling applied in QGIS to represent seperate GDP and per capita income.  
- Map edited and exported as PDFs using QGIS Print Layout for sharing.  
- High-quality PDF map provided as a visual reference of the final output.

## Baden-Württemberg Wind Direction and Speed Map  
- Wind Speed/Direction and geographical data sourced from Nasa Data access viewer & gadm.org respectively.  
- Data imported as CSV files and joined in QGIS to create directional layers.  
- Interpoplation and classification applied using coordinate system in QGIS to demonstrate wind and surface pressure data in visual manner.
- Map edited and exported as PDFs using QGIS Print Layout for sharing.  
- High-quality PDF map provided as a visual reference of the final output.
